# Solana Mobile dApp Scaffold
A ready-to-go template Solana Mobile React Native dApp with dependencies installed and basic React UI components.
It provides an interface to connect to locally installed wallet apps (that are MWA-compatible), view your account balance on devnet, and request an airdrop of SOL.

This React Native dApp is only fully functional on Android.

The app showcases basic usage of the Solana Mobile Javascript SDK including:
- Mobile Wallet Adapter (@solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter-protocol)
- web3.js
- @solana/wallet-adapter-react
